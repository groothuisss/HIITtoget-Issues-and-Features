_Feature tracker for the interval training app "HIIT to get.fit"_

**This repository does not host code, but is only used for tracking issues and new features of the _HIIT to get.fit_ interval training app.**

Go to "Issues" to read what's going on or to add features or issues yourself.


## HIIT to get.fit
_HIIT to get.fit_ is a biometrics-based alternative to time-based interval training apps. It uses heart rate measurements to estimate cardiovascular output and performance in real time. No more one-size-fits-all approach to exercising and in particular to interval training, but an exercising aid to help gain results more effectively and efficiently.

## Main features

Some features of the app include:

- Interval training guidance based on the actual exercise output and physical fitness: tells you when to work and when to rest based on the training goal you set;
- Cardiovascular drift compensation to negate effects of temperature and dehydration on the body;
- Real-time estimation of cardiovascular output, rate of oxygen uptake, time spent near V'O2max, etcetera.
